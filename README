Using HTML, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap, create a professional-looking web page for a fake product, service, or application.

1) Your project must include a one-page layout with navigation and at least one other 'live' page

2) It must have a nav section with tabs or pills

3) It must have at least one input box, for example "sign up for our newsletter" or "login" (they do not have to actually work)

4) It must include at least two buttons, one of which launches a modal box (which doesn't have to do anything)

5) It must include several images which you can find on wikimedia commons or edit them yourself using Photoshop or GIMP


Github requirements

Your Github project must include at least 10 commits over the course of 5 different days. Each commit should have a meaningful commit message that explains exactly what was changed since the last iteration.
